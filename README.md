# MIT-FutureMakers

I completed two main apps during the MIT FutureMakers SureStart Program for the APP-a-thon event and the Create-A-Thon Event.

For the App-A-Thon, my group and I created an app which allows users to play a game where they are the major of their own city. It is their job to solve the numerous problems that they can solve. It is also their job to make sure that the wellbeing of their 'citizens' is positive. We created this app to help teach people about the problems within the city.

For the Create-A-Thon. my group and I created an app which allows users to either buy, sell, or donate devices used for schools such as computers, laptops, smartboards, and tablets. This allows users to find affordable devices for school in their local area or they can give their devices to someone who needs it.

Uploaded into the repository is the .aia file for the two apps, developed with code. To access the code and app, the .aia needs to be uploaded into the MIT App Inventor website or any other source that supports an .aia file.
